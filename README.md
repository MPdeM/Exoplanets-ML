# Exoplanets-ML

I am using ML to play around with data collected by NASA while the Kepler space telescope was collecting data to discover planets outside our solar system. 

The data es read with Pandas as a csv. It is preprocess by selecting featires and scaling id usind MinMaxScalar 

The data is separated into train and test  sets before being fet to a model 

First SVn is applied and the parameters are hyper tuned  using GridSearch 

The secon model used is Keras to build and train deep neural network
